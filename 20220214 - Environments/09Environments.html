## Scoping and environments

- I have previously mentioned "scoping" in R (remember vegas)
- Generally confusing that some parts of R can't "see" other parts



```r
x&lt;-200
f&lt;-function(x){
  x&lt;-x+1
  return(x)
}
f(x) # do something to x
```

```
## [1] 201
```

```r
x # but nothing has changed!
```

```
## [1] 200
```


---

And sometimes you have functions that share a name but do different things!


```r
# Let's use a function
die&lt;-1:6
sample(die, 2) # Roll a die twice
```

```
## [1] 2 5
```

```r
sample&lt;-function(x, ...){return("Would you like to try some of this wine?")}
sample(die, 2) # Now it does something else!
```

```
## [1] "Would you like to try some of this wine?"
```

--


How does R know what to do in these cases?  And what is this?

```r
base::sample(die, 2)
```

```
## [1] 5 2
```


---

## What's an environment?

- Loosely speaking, an 'environment' is the local neighborhood an R object lives in (and remember that all functions are objects).
- An object will **first** look around for objects in it's own environment.
- If it's not there, it will look through other environments in a specific order.
- The various environment have a strict order.


---

We can think of an environment as an objects "neighborhood".



```r
# Can you tell me how to get .... 
library(rlang)
sesame.street&lt;-env(
                elmo="Elmo wants a cookie.",
                cookie="Me want cookie!",
                count="I count one cookie.  Mwhahahaha!"
                )
sesame.street # standard printing  doesn't help
```

```
## &lt;environment: 0x7fe0248aa8a0&gt;
```

```r
env_print(sesame.street) # rlang provides a way to help out
```

```
## &lt;environment: 0x7fe0248aa8a0&gt;
## parent: &lt;environment: global&gt;
## bindings:
##  * count: &lt;chr&gt;
##  * elmo: &lt;chr&gt;
##  * cookie: &lt;chr&gt;
```


---

## Why environments: Reducing conflicts

Let's say I want to count the length of a string and make a new function `count`.


```r
count&lt;-function(x){
  return(length(x))
}
```

Now I have two objects called `count` out there!  But they are located in different environments.


```r
global_env()$count ## this count lives in the global environment
```

```
## function(x){
##   return(length(x))
## }
```

```r
sesame.street$count ## this count lives on sesame street
```

```
## [1] "I count one cookie.  Mwhahahaha!"
```


---

## Reducing conflicts: How?

The key here is that objects (including functions) first look around in their *own* environment before looking for objects somewhere else.

Imagine we have a function with the same name in two environments.

```r
middle.earth&lt;-env(
                ending=function(x){
                  paste("And when I got home I said", x)
                },
                frodo="G'day mate!"
                )
# Add a function with the same name to sesame.street
sesame.street$ending=function(x){
  paste("Whenever I find a cookie I say:", x)
}
```


---

So what's going to happen here?


```r
with_env(sesame.street, ending(elmo))
with_env(middle.earth, ending(elmo))
with_env(middle.earth, ending(frodo))
```

---

## Special environments: Packages and namespaces

- When you make an R package, you create a special package environment and something called a 'namespace'.  For today, you can think of this as an enclosed environment that keep packages from interfering with each other.  

- Any object defined in a package will *always* look **first** to other functions and objects defined in the package.  This prevents one package from interfering with the internal workings of another.

--

- However, there is still the issue of multiple packages having objects with the same name.  

---



```r
library(pryr)
```

```
## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'pryr':
##   method      from
##   print.bytes Rcpp
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'pryr'
```

```
## The following object is masked _by_ '.GlobalEnv':
## 
##     f
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:rlang':
## 
##     bytes
```

---

### Dealing with package conflicts

R will look for objects in package environments in the reverse order in which they were loaded.

```r
search()
```

```
##  [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:pryr"      "package:rlang"    
##  [4] "package:stats"     "package:graphics"  "package:grDevices"
##  [7] "package:utils"     "package:datasets"  "package:methods"  
## [10] "Autoloads"         "package:base"
```

--

You can also directly access objects in a package environment using the `::` options.  You can even do this for packages you have not loaded.


```r
exampleData&lt;-data.frame(a=c(1:12))
count(exampleData) ## Does one thing -- defined above
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
dplyr::count(exampleData) ## Does something else
```

```
##    n
## 1 12
```


---

## Function and environments

Remember the concept of 'scoping' and how what happens in a function stays in a function.  This is a result (but only one) of how functions and environments interact.


```r
x&lt;-200
f&lt;-function(x){
  x&lt;-x+1
  return(x)
}
f(x) # do something to x
```

```
## [1] 201
```

```r
x # but nothing has changed!
```

```
## [1] 200
```

---

1. Functions are **created** in an *enclosing* environment.  This is basically where the function lives (and where it will first look for other objects).
2. Functions are called in a *calling* environment.  This is the environment where the function was actually used (or called).
3. While a function is executing it creates a temporary environment (the actual guts of the function run there).
4. There is also a *binding environment* we'll come back to when we make packages.

--

What this means...

- If you want objects to be used across environments they are going to need to be "passed" in as either arguments or outputs.

--

- Or you are going to need some other hack to jump across environments.

--

- And debugging can be a pain because it can be hard to figure out what your function can "see".

---

## Trick 1

You can (but usually should not) have functions directly alter objects in their calling environment using `&lt;&lt;-`


```r
x&lt;-200
f&lt;-function(x){
  x&lt;&lt;-x+1
  return(x)
}
f(x) # do something to x
```

```
## [1] 200
```

```r
x
```

```
## [1] 201
```


---

## Trick 2

You can use the `browser` function to stop execution so you can hang out in the function environment.


```r
x&lt;-200
f&lt;-function(x){
  browser()
  return(x)
}
f(x) # do something to x
```


---

## Parent environments

Environments are not always organized as a strict sequence.


```r
search()
```

BUT there is a strict hierarchy.  Each environment has one and only one parent (except for the global which has none).


```r
parent.env(sesame.street) # See parent
parent.env(middle.earth) # See parent
parent.env(sesame.street)&lt;-env(middle.earth) # Change parent
with_env(sesame.street, ending(frodo)) # Now this works.  Why?
with_env(middle.earth, ending(elmo)) # Still doesn't work. Why?
```

---

## Final tips


For the worksheet, you are going to manually move objects from the global into an environment.


```r
bombadil &lt;- "Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow, Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow."
assign("bombadil", bombadil, envir=middle.earth)
rm(bombadil)
bombadil
middle.earth$bombadil
```

---

I could do the same thing using a generic function


```r
Abby &lt;- "abracadabra."

## Function to assign to an environment
toSesameStreet&lt;-function(x, targetEnv){
## Use deparse, substitute to pull out object name from calling environment
  assign(deparse(substitute(x)), x, envir=targetEnv) 
}

toSesameStreet(Abby, sesame.street) #Assign Abby there
rm(Abby) # Remove from global
sesame.street$Abby
```
